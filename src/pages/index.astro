      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight dark:text-white sm:text-3xl mb-2">About me</h2>
      <p>
        I've created conditions where people stopped defending and upped their performance. Clarity became irreversible,
        people couldn't retreat into comfortable illusions and were inspired to let go of defences so old patterns
        didn't contaminate the work.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Once people taste genuine clarity and real collaboration, they don't accept less. They've seen what's possible.
        Over the last years I've studied psychology to get underneath what made this possible—how groups actually
        function, what enables or blocks performance, what creates the relational foundation that makes everything else
        work.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Now I work with leaders and organisations who recognise that exceptional performance comes from understanding
        what's really happening between people. Grounded alongside strategy, structure and processes.
