January 2011. Nokia's Chief Development Officer Kai Öistämö walks into Stephen Elop's office with devastating news about MeeGo. Twenty interviews with the team. Different parts of the business building incompatible frameworks. Years wasted. Leadership dysfunction. At their current pace, only three MeeGo devices by the end of 2014.

Elop has been CEO for four months. The anxiety is overwhelming. Board pressure. Competitive threats. Internal paralysis. A company that's been lying to itself for years.

Öistämö leaves. Elop sits alone in his office, the assessment document on his desk. Outside, Helsinki is grey and frozen. Inside, he's aware of his heartbeat pulsing in his ears, he knows he won't sleep well tonight. 

The board expects decisive action. Wall Street is watching. Sixty-five thousand employees need direction. The dysfunction Öistämö described—teams competing instead of collaborating, years wasted on incompatible frameworks, leadership vacuums—it's worse than he thought.

Unknown to him, two responses are available. Both are real. Both feel necessary in this moment.

One: discharge the stress and worry immediately. The fix is in. He knows Microsoft have the technology, he can justify the switch. Just create a crisis big enough to justify a dramatic solution.

The other response? Pause, hold the moment. Process it. Return what's happening to the organisation in a form they can actually use.

In this moment, sitting alone with unbearable feelings, these two futures diverge.

## What Actually Happened

### The Moment That Killed Nokia

Over the next three weeks, Elop formulates an email.

*A man wakes up on an oil platform in the North Sea to flames and smoke. He makes it to the edge and looks down at freezing Atlantic waters. Two choices: stay and burn, or jump and hope.*

On February 3, 2011, Elop sends it to 65,000 employees: "Our platform is burning. We poured gasoline on our own burning platform. I believe we have lacked accountability and leadership."

It leaks to the press on February 8.

February 11: Nokia and Microsoft announce their partnership. Windows Phone becomes Nokia's primary platform. Symbian is finished. MeeGo will ship one device, then nothing. The first Windows Phone won't arrive until November. Nine months away.

In the MeeGo office in Helsinki, engineers watch via webcast. Almost everyone goes straight to the bars. They don't come back for days. In Tampere, where 1,500 people work on Symbian, a thousand employees walk out at 2 PM.

A European telecom CEO later recalls: "We wondered what bush these guys have stuck their heads in. Elop's mistake was completely obvious and ate billions of euros from Nokia. Nobody wanted Symbian phones anymore."

Network providers stop ordering Nokia phones immediately.

Another director describes meeting Nokia's sales team days after: "They looked completely lost. I've never been in such a horrible meeting. Some were late, some may be hung over. They showed the new models but joked about whether they were any good."

Nokia's UK market share in September 2010, before Elop became CEO: 23.1%. By February 2011: 12.4%. By September 2011: 6.7%. By February 2012: 4.6%.

Four out of five customers, gone.

Carriers refused to sell Nokia smartphones. Component suppliers downgraded Nokia from first-class to second-class. The best engineers left for Google, Apple, Intel. 

In September 2013, Microsoft bought Nokia's phone business for \$7.2 billion, roughly what Nokia had lost in market capitalisation in the two days after the Windows Phone announcement.

The Burning Platform email became known as the most damaging single management communication in business history.

But in that moment in January, sitting with Öistämö's assessment, another response was available.

## What Might Have Been

### Elop Takes The Lead

Elop sits with the moment. It's overwhelming, but he recognises this feeling. This is what a crisis feels like from the inside. The urge to act, to fix, to discharge the unbearable feeling—it's almost irresistible.

But he also recognises something else: this anxiety isn't his alone. It's a collective anxiety. It's been building for years. If he discharges it through dramatic action, he let's everyone off the hook for years of dysfunction.

Therefore he makes a different choice. Time to speak plainly, no sugar coating or avoiding the issues.

He picks up the phone. Calls Öistämö back. "Kai, thank you for the honesty. This is the first completely truthful assessment I've heard since arriving. We need more of this, not less."

Silence on the line. Then: "Stephen, I wasn't sure how you'd react."

"Neither was I," Elop admits. "But I'm sure now. We don't have a technology problem. We have a truth problem."

The next morning, Elop convenes the leadership team in the glass-walled conference room overlooking frozen Helsinki harbour. Eighteen executives. Most have been with Nokia for over a decade. They're expecting another strategic review, another consultant presentation, another reorganisation chart.

Instead, Elop places Öistämö's assessment on the table.

"Kai's team interviewed twenty people about MeeGo. Different parts of the business working in isolation. Competing with each other. Years wasted on incompatible frameworks. At our current pace, we'll have three devices by 2014." He pauses. "But the assessment reveals something more important. Teams are competing because they're afraid. People aren't collaborating because telling the truth is dangerous here."

The room goes silent.

"Before we choose any platform strategy, we must fix how we work together. I see factions, politics, fraying tempers. I need to know who creates it, why it persists?"

One executive, face flushed: "Stephen, the board wants action. They want a platform decision. They want—"

"The board hired me to save this company. I can't save a company that can't tell itself the truth. We fix that first."

This is what Wilfred Bion\[^1] calls containment—a good leader can hold an organisation's anxiety long enough for thinking to emerge. No need to eliminate the anxiety. No denying it. Holding it.

---

### Confronting Without Confrontation

Over the next three weeks, Elop has conversations that make his leadership really uncomfortable. Rather than rational conversations, he highlights behaviours: the shouting, impatience and frustration. And the lack of knowledge about operational realities.

He meets Alberto Torres, VP of MeeGo, in his office at 7 AM. Torres arrives with a presentation deck defending his team's progress. Elop gestures it away.

"Alberto, I've spoken with twelve people on your team. Confidentially. They respect your technical knowledge. But they don't trust you to protect them. Why?"

Torres's jaw tightens. "That's not—"

"Four people independently used the phrase 'credibility problem.' Three said they've stopped bringing you issues because you shoot the messenger. One said watching you in meetings makes their 'stomach hurt.'"

Silence. Morning light through the window shows Torres's face going pale.

"You have two choices," Elop continues. "Step aside from MeeGo leadership, or spend the next six months rebuilding trust in front of everyone. Publicly acknowledge what you got wrong. Work with a coach. Show people you can change. Either choice is honourable. But choose now."

Torres takes forty-eight hours. He chooses to step aside. But instead of leaving Nokia, he works with his replacement to document everything he's learned. At an all-hands meeting, he says: "This is the first time anyone's asked me to be honest about what I got wrong. Turns out it's a relief."

Three senior managers known for shouting get similar conversations. Two leave. One stays and transforms. The one who stays later says: "Stephen gave me a choice between my ego and my future. Choosing the future was terrifying. But it saved my career."

This is what Melanie Klein\[^2] called the depressive position—the capacity to acknowledge you've caused harm, to feel genuine remorse, to make reparation. Torres couldn't reach it and stay in his role, so he stepped aside.

But a manager who shouted at his people changed. With a coach he thrived—becoming more open, learning to apologise, and providing clearer direction about goals rather than micromanaging how his team did the work.

### Naming Reality

On February 11, Elop addresses the company. Not via email. In person, in Espoo, with video links to every office. 65,000 people are tuned in. The bandwidth struggles. The image pixelates occasionally. But everyone is watching.

Elop speaks for seven minutes. No slides. No metaphors about burning platforms. Just truth.

"For years, we've been lying to each other. About timelines. About quality. About what's working and what isn't. That ends today. I'm not interested in preserving anyone's dignity, including my own. I'm interested in preserving this company."

The video feed shows engineers in Tampere shifting in their seats. In Beijing, someone's face is very close to the camera, listening intently.

"Kai Öistämö brought me an assessment of MeeGo. Twenty interviews revealing that teams are competing instead of collaborating. Years wasted on incompatible frameworks. Leadership dysfunction. It's devastating. But this was honest. We need more honesty like this."

In the Helsinki office, people are watching each other as much as the screen. Can this be real? Can a CEO actually say these things?

"MeeGo is delayed. Symbian is struggling. Android is gaining share. These are facts. But here's another fact: we have 2,000 of the world's best mobile engineers. I believe the N9 will prove our technology is viable. Our problem isn't our capability. It's cooperation, or lack of it."

He pauses. The image freezes and judders a little, but the sound is clear.

"Over the next six months, we're going to become an organisation that can tell itself the truth. Some leaders will leave, some did already. Some teams will be restructured. Some of you will find this intolerable. Market share, our revenues will be impacted during the transition. But we are investing in fixing what's broken."

"For those who stay, we're going to build something we can be proud of. Not because we have the best technology—though we might. But because we stopped working against each other, and chose to come together. That's the only competitive advantage that actually matters."

"Together, we are Nokia."

The feed ends. Engineers don't go to the bars. They go back to their desks, uncertain but not panicked.

One Linux developer later recalls: "I was ready to leave. But when Elop named the real problem—that we couldn't work together—I wanted to see if he meant it."

This is what Howard Schwartz\[^3] calls breaking the self-sealing organisation. Success had made Nokia impermeable to reality. Elop's speech created a puncture. Not a fire. A puncture that let reality in.

### Proving It

Nokia's UK market share in February 2011: 16.8%. Still falling, but not collapsing. By April: 15.2%. By June: 14.7%.

Bleeding, not hemorrhaging.

But the real change is invisible to market share numbers. It's in the meeting room in Tampere where the Symbian team, told honestly that their platform is being sunset, works with the MeeGo team to plan migration paths for developers. It's in the Helsinki office where someone flags a quality issue with the N9's touchscreen calibration three weeks before launch, and instead of being shouted at, gets thanked.

It's in the email exchange where an engineer writes: "We're still going to lose to iPhone and Android, aren't we?" And Elop, who tries to respond to direct messages, replies: "Probably. But we'll lose with dignity, not chaos. And the company we save might build something better afterward."

In June 2011, the N9 launches to rave reviews. "The best phone Nokia ever made," tech journalists write. The interface is elegant. The hardware is beautiful. Swipe gestures feel intuitive, natural in ways Android doesn't.

Instead of cancelling MeeGo devices, Elop instead tells them: "This proves MeeGo works. Whether we expand it depends on whether we can cooperate well enough to support an ecosystem. That's on all of us. My leadership will make a decision on exactly how, and I will hold them accountable to the plan."

Carriers are sceptical but watching. One telecom VP observes: "Nokia's usual corporate bullshit has been replaced by something unusual. Honesty about their problems. We're willing to see where it goes."

Three hundred developers stay who were planning to leave. Not because the future is certain. Because the present is honest.

### Shared Struggle

By September 2011, the platform decision can't wait any longer. The leadership team has spent six months learning to work together. The fear culture hasn't disappeared—fear cultures don't disappear quickly—but it's been punctured. People speak up more often.

The decision comes in a three-day offsite. Not in Helsinki. In a converted farmhouse two hours north, where there's no phone signal and the September rain means everyone is glad to be inside. They're looking forward to visiting the sauna, a reward after some tough discussions ahead.

Eighteen people. The arguments last hours. Someone cries in frustration. Someone else admits they've been wrong about Android licensing for two years. The MeeGo team and Symbian team, who've spent five years competing, finally collaborate on a joint assessment.

On day three, consensus emerges. Not Windows Phone. A dual strategy: MeeGo for high-end devices, Symbian for transitional markets, with brutal clarity about Symbian's sunset timeline.

But more importantly, the decision comes from a leadership team that now trusts each other. 

This is what Isabel Menzies Lyth\[^4] showed in her hospital studies—organisations and teams develop social defences against anxiety, processes that may work but aren't optimal. These defences protect individuals whilst neutralising the collaboration necessary to adjust. Nokia's fear culture had been exactly that. By naming it, Elop made hiding the truth less necessary because dealing with reality was met with support.

### The Long Recovery

Every organisation offers a bargain. Give us your effort, your intelligence, your loyalty. In return, we give you identity, belonging, purpose. The organisation provides status and connection. You provide cooperation.

Nokia's bargain had been broken for years. Engineers gave effort and got fear. They gave intelligence and got their ideas ignored. They gave loyalty and watched mediocre leaders shout at them.

Elop's first six months didn't restore the bargain completely. That would take years. But he made the bargain credible again.

A long-term Nokia employee explains: "Before February, I just kept my head down keeping work to myself. After February, I came into the office and could talk about problems! This focus is what I needed to start contributing."

By early 2012, Nokia's market share has stabilised at 11-13% in key markets. Not dominant. Not victorious. But viable. The organisation that had been consuming itself has learned to cooperate.

Therefore something unexpected becomes possible.

The N9's success reveals a path iOS and Android haven't taken. Apple controls everything. Google surveils everything. Nokia, suddenly honest about its limitations, focuses on what European customers actually want: devices that respect privacy, that don't treat users as data to be monetised, that work across platforms without lock-in.

By 2013, MeeGo evolves into something neither iOS nor Android can easily copy: an open platform where privacy is architectural, you share data as a conscious choice and keep control of what's shared. European regulators notice. So do European customers realising they can fend off surveillance capitalism and Apple's closed garden.

Market share stops falling. By 2014, it ticks upward in Germany, France, Scandinavia. Not dramatically. Two percentage points here, three there. But the direction has changed.

When Microsoft approaches about acquisition in 2013, Elop declines. Nokia isn't burning. The board, seeing the first green shoots of recovery, backs him. The engineers who might have fled to California stay in Helsinki, Tampere, Berlin. They're building something that matters.

By 2016, Nokia holds 18% of the European smartphone market. Still third behind Apple and Samsung, but growing. The cooperation capability Elop rebuilt translates into product capability. Features ship on time. Quality improves. 3rd party developers who abandoned Symbian return to MeeGo because the APIs finally make sense, because the teams actually respond to feedback, because collaboration works.

In 2017, something shifts. Voice assistants are everywhere—Siri, Google Assistant, Alexa—but they're cloud-dependent, data-hungry, privacy-destroying. Nokia's engineers, now working in teams that trust each other, see the opening. What if AI processing happened on-device? What if the assistant didn't need to reach out to a remote backend? 

The technical debt that paralysed them in 2011 has been paid down through years of honest collaboration. The architectural decisions that once took months of political warfare now take weeks of genuine debate. By 2018, Nokia devices ship with on-device AI that runs circles around cloud-dependent competitors for speed and privacy.

European customers notice. European regulators love it. By 2020, Nokia is the European choice—not dominant globally, but unassailable in its home market. Twenty-eight percent European market share. And growing.

## What Made the Difference

Back in that moment in January 2011, sitting alone in his office after Öistämö left, Elop faced the same anxiety that every leader faces in crisis.

The urge to act out—to discharge the unbearable feeling through dramatic action—is almost irresistible. Sigmund Freud\[^5] called this acting out, when anxiety bypasses thought entirely and erupts into action. You can't contain the feeling, so you discharge it.

The alternative, working through, is slower and more painful. It means actually integrating difficult reality rather than fleeing from it. It means holding the anxiety long enough for thinking to emerge.

In our actual history, Elop chose acting out. He created the Burning Platform crisis. He manufactured urgency that justified jumping into Microsoft's arms.

In the alternative, he chose working through. He acknowledged the anxiety. Held it. Processed it. Returned it to the organisation in a form they could manage.

Both paths were available. The fork in the road was real.

But the second path required something the real Elop couldn't provide: the capacity to be what Bion called a container. To take in the organisation's unbearable feelings, hold them without discharging them, and return them as something manageable.

Why couldn't he? He was an outsider with no organic authority. No relationships built over years. Hired specifically for dramatic change, not culture work. Facing intense board pressure for immediate visible action. The pull back to what he knew—Microsoft thinking, buy the solution rather than build capability—was overwhelming.

So he chose the drama of starting a fire.

## The Lesson

**Companies solve the wrong problems when leaders choose drama over containment, action over facing anxiety, speed over speaking the truth.**

Saving a company requires something extraordinary. It demands 2,000 engineers learning to work together after years of siloed dysfunction. It requires 18 executives building enough trust to make decisions that hurt their own divisions for the company's good. It needs middle managers feeling safe enough to speak truth to power without fear of retribution. A decisive CEO can make the bold first move, but transformation happens only when the entire organisation learns to collaborate and communicate effectively. Salvation requires the entire organism learning to cooperate with itself—a slow, painful process of rebuilding connection, restoring shared reality, and focusing joint attention on genuine problems rather than political survival. It's hard. But it's possible.

Nokia's bargain was already fragile when Elop arrived. Years of fear culture had damaged cooperation. But it wasn't destroyed. Engineers were still there. Capability was still there. The N9 would prove the technology worked. The foundation for transformation existed.

Destroying a company is so much easier. Drama paired with fear is destructive.

Every organisation lives inside stories that define it—stories about what's working, what's broken, who's to blame, what must be done. Nokia was full of such stories. Stories about Finnish engineering brilliance. Stories about Symbian's invincibility. Stories about iPhone being a toy for Americans. These stories had sealed the organisation off from reality.

Elop arrived carrying his own stories. Stories about burning platforms. Stories about Microsoft as salvation. His Burning Platform memo didn't puncture Nokia's false stories with reality. It replaced them with a more dramatic story. A story so urgent, so terrifying that it made reflection impossible. The new story said: everything is so broken that only drastic action will fix it.

This is what drama does. It bends organisational will toward proving the drama was justified. Energy that could have gone to painful reflection—to actually addressing the fear culture, the leadership dysfunction, the cooperation failures—instead went to proving that jumping was the only rational choice. Drama doesn't solve problems; it replaces one set of anxiety-reducing narratives with another, more urgent set that makes thinking impossible.

The alternative required puncturing stories constantly. Without that constant puncturing—without saying "stop, let's check if this story matches what's actually happening"—organisations remain locked inside whatever narrative feels most anxiety-reducing in the moment.

The man on the oil platform had three choices, not two. Stay and burn. Jump into freezing water. Or organise the crew to fight the fire.

Organising the crew means puncturing the story that says "we're doomed." It means sitting with anxiety long enough to ask: "What's actually on fire? What's actually saveable?" Both futures existed in that moment in January, sitting alone in his office with Öistämö's assessment on the desk.

But you can't organise a crew to fight a fire when the leader has already declared the platform doomed.

You can't rebuild cooperation when the leader's opening move sets fire to reality.
